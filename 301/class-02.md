- The Data Flows Down

### [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements, there are some syntax differences:
  * React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase
  * With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string
- Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

### [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need, then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application

### [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- Rendering Multiple Components
- Basic List Component
- Keys
- Extracting Components with Keys
- Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings
- Embedding map() in JSX

### [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state
- Controlled Components
- The textarea Tag
- The select Tag
- The file input Tag
- Handling Multiple Inputs
- Controlled Input Null Value
- Alternatives to Controlled Components
- Fully-Fledged Solutions

### [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data
- Adding a Second Input
- Writing Conversion Functions
- Lifting State Up
- Lessons Learned

### [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- Containment
- Specialization

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them
