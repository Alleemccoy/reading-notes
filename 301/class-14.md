### [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)
Modern computer science is dominated by men, but it hasn't always been that way...

- A lot of the early computer pioneers were women, the numbers were even growing but in 1984 something changed.
  * Early computers weren't much more then "toys" at the time, when personal computers started showing up the number of women in computer science started to drop
  * The narrative and movies made "techies" into a male idea, and that computer games were for boys and they would "win" the girl
  * In the 1990's researchers interviews hundreds of computer science students at a college and found that families were much more likely to buy computers for bots over girls, even when their daughters were really interested in computers
  * This was a pretty big deal because as computer science continued to grow boys had more of a chance to play with their personal computers and therefore learn

Reading Questions:
**1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
  * Personal computers became more common.
**2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
  * Because families were more likely to buy personal computers for boys they had more chances to play and learn on their computer, another thing to keep in mind is that boys were playing games with the intension of "winning the girl" at the end.

  * I have heard of examples in tech where when testing they did not have someone with darker skin test and later found that the censor could not read/ pick up on darker skin tones.


  ## Things I want to know more about:
  - In the United States I wonder if another reason the numbers are so different because the racial population is what it is.
