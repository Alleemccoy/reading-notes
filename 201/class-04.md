# **Class 4 Reading Notes**

- Directory Structure
  * Parent, Child, Grandparent, Grandchild

  * Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files
- Email Links
  * mailto:
- Opening Links in a New Window

### Chapter 15 Overview: LAYOUT
- Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
  * Building Blocks, Containing Elements
- Controlling the Position of Elements
  * Normal Flow
  * Relative Positioning
  * Absolute Positioning
  * Fixed Positioning
  * Floating Elements
- Screen Sizes
  * Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens
- Screen Resolution
  * Resolution refers to the number of dots a screens shows per inch
- Page Sizes
- Fixed Width Layouts
  * Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window
  * Measurements tend to be given in pixels
- Liquid Layouts
  * Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window
  * They tend to use percentages

## *JavaScript & jQuery*

### Chapter 3 Overview: FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS *pages 86-99*
- What is a Function?
  * Functions let you group a series of statements together to preform a specific task
  * If different parts of a script repeat the same tasks, you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements
- Declaring a Function
  * To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces - this is known as a **function declaration**
- Calling a Function
  * Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code - this is known as **calling the function**
- Declaring Functions That Need Information
  * Sometimes a function needs specific information to preform its task
  * In such cases, when you declare the function you give it **parameters**
  * Inside the function, the parameters act like variables
- Calling Functions That Need Information
  * When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name
  * The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables
- Getting a Single Value Out of a Function
  * Some functions return information to the code that called them
- Getting Multiple Values Out of a Function
  * Functions can return more than one value using an array
