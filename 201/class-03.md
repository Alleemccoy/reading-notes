## *JavaScript & jQuery*

### Chapter 2 Overview: BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS *pages 70-73*
- Arrays
  * You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a **list** or a set of values that are related to each other.
- Creating an Array
  * You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable
  * The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma
  * The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array
  * The technique for creating an array is known as an **array literal**
- Values in Arrays
  * Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list
  * It is important to know that **the numbering of list starts at zero, not one**
- Accessing & Changing Values in an Array


### Chapter 4 Overview: DECISIONS AND LOOPS *pages 162-182*
- if else Statements
  * if else statement checks a condition
- Using if else Statements
  * *Yes, you passed!* **or** *Try Again..* and continue script
- Switch Statements
  * A **switch** statement starts with a variable called the **switch value**
  * Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value
  * You have a default option that is run if non is the cases match
  * If a match is found, that code is run; then the **break** statement stops the rest of the switch statement running
- Using Switch Statements
- Type Coercion & Weak Typing
  * JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation
- Truthy & Falsy Values
- Checking Equality & Existence
- Short Circuit Values
- Loops
  * Loops check a condition
  * If it returns **true**, a code block will run
  * The condition will be checked again and it if still returns **true**, the code clock will run again
  * It repeats until the condition returns **false**
  * **Three common types of loops:** *FOR, WHILE and DO WHILE*
- Loop Counters
  * A **for** loop uses a counter as a condition
  * This instructs the code to run a specified number of times
  * *Initialization, Condition, Update*
- Key Loop Concepts
- Using For Loops
  * A **for** loop is often used to loop through the items in an array
- Using While Loops
- Using DO While Loops
